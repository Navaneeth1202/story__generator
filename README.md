# 🧠 AI Story Generator

A command-line Python application that uses **Cohere's Large Language Model (LLM)** to generate fun, engaging, and dynamic stories based on user input.

## ✨ Project Description

**AI Story Generator** is an interactive storytelling tool powered by **Cohere's AI model**. It allows users to create original stories from scratch by specifying:

- ✅ Genre (Sci-Fi, Fantasy, Horror, Rom-Com)
- ✅ Main Characters
- ✅ Custom Setting / Prompt

Once the story is generated, users can choose to:
- 🔁 **Continue** the story with new twists
- ✅ **Conclude** the story in a suspenseful or satisfying way

This project showcases how **Generative AI** can enhance creative writing, providing a great learning experience for developers working with LLMs.
